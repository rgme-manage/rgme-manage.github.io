		<h3>Teaching from Experience: The Influence of Graduate Coursework on a TA’s Instructional Identity</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Peter Karanevich</b> (University of Colorado Boulder) -- June 3, 2025 </br> </br>

			Karanevich shared his recent research. </br> </br>

			<i>Abstract.</i> Teaching is an extremely complex and intimate practice. Research shows that teaching practices are developed through a variety of avenues, one of them being the instructor’s experience as a learner (Olseson & Hora, 2014). Graduate students in mathematics are positioned as both learners and teachers of mathematics. In this talk, I will discuss a case example of a graduate student in mathematics who has experiences as both a student and a teaching assistant of mathematics. I will focus on the various graduate classroom experiences he has had as well as his reflection on teaching. A key tension I wish to discuss is the lack of teacher training coupled with the lecture heavy instruction he receives in his coursework and how that can limit or delay the shaping of his instructional practice that reflects the inquiry model that mathematics teaching is headed toward.

		<h3>Results and Reflections about Mathematics Graduate Student Instructor Development</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Johan Cristobal</b> (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) -- April 29, 2025 </br> </br>

			Cristobal shared an overview of his doctoral research. </br> </br>

			<i>Abstract.</i> One of the driving forces of my dissertation research is understanding the experiences of mathematics graduate student instructors (MGSIs) in order to understand how to better support them. In this presentation, I want to give a brief overview of my full dissertation work and then transition into focusing on results pertaining to MGSIs' development. The other half of the presentation will focus on my reflections about my dissertation work. I hope to facilitate more discussion on the nature and ethics of conducting research with MGSIs.

		<h3>A Preliminary Investigation into the Language Choices of Chinese International Math Scholars</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Matt Park</b> (Virginia Tech) -- January 20, 2025 </br> </br>

			Park shared his recent research. </br> </br>

			<i>Abstract.</i> As international students from China continue to work in the United States, research has emerged about their experiences, driven by Chinese and Americans alike. While many studies attend to topics such as how international students adjust to living and working in the United States, or the differences they notice in Western and Eastern pedagogy, the details of the day-to-day work of such scholars remain under-discussed. After briefly discussing some literature about international Chinese STEM students, I present two themes from preliminary data from international Chinese math faculty members that indicate factors that impact the languages they choose in their professional work such as research or teaching.

		<h3>Exploring Women’s Identities in Doctoral Mathematics: A Figured Worlds Lens</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Talia LaTona-Tequida</b> (San Diego State University) -- November 13, 2024 </br> </br>
			Latona-Tequida presented an overview of her dissertation research. </br> </br>

			<i>Abstract.</i> Women in advanced mathematics continue to be underrepresented despite representational progress in K-16 mathematics. Previous research has identified individual factors and features of local context which may contribute to women’s persistence and sense of belonging in doctoral mathematics. However, more work is needed to understand the broader societal factors which work to marginalize women in advanced mathematics. Mathematics education researchers have leveraged an identity lens to understand these factors at the undergraduate level. I extend this work using a figured worlds framework to investigate the mathematical identities of five women pursuing a PhD in mathematics. Preliminary results from thematic analysis of narrative interviews and a focus group reveal common themes among the participants related to ways they negotiate their gender–anticipating doubt, proving yourself, and transcending gender. I contextualize these results in a broader discussion about my research trajectory in graduate mathematics education with a focus on departmental change that supports students from nondominant groups.

		<h3>Where to Publish Your RGME Work</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. Brady Tyburski</b> (University of Georgia) -- October 23, 2024</br> </br>
			Dr. Tyburski led a discussion on what journal outlets are possible for graduate mathematics education work. You can access these resources here: <a href = "./resources" target = "_self">Resources & Links</a>.

		<h3>Mathematics Graduate Students' Professional Identity Development</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Royce Olarte</b> (University of California, Santa Barbara) -- September 30, 2024</br> </br>
			Olarte gave his job talk. In this, he shared sociocultural perspectives on graduate students' professional identity development, discourses in graduate mathematics education, and new qualitative research approaches to examine graduate students' identity development. <b>Video recording to be added.</b>
		</p>

		<h3>Mathematical Creativity</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Dr. Shanna Dobson</b> (California State University, Los Angeles) and <b>Dr. Miloš Savić</b> (University of Oklahoma) -- July 29, 2024 </br></br>
			
			In this dual presentation, Dr. Dobson and Dr. Savić each presented an overview of mathematical creativity theory and some results. <b>Video recording to be added.</b>
		</p>

		<h3>What is happening in (Graduate) Mathematics Education?</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Anna Mikulo</b> (University of Oklahoma), <b>Matt Park</b> (Virginia Tech), and <b>Deewang Hamidi</b> (University of California, Santa Cruz) -- July 2, 2024 </br></br>
			Mikulo, Park, and Hamidi gave a brief overview of research methods in mathematics education research. Others were also invited to give brief, 5-minute talks on the research methods they employ or particularly like. Then, time was dedicated to sharing research proposals, where attendees briefly discussed research projects they are interested in and search out collaborators.
