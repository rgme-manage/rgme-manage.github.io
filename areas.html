				<div class="card"> <h3>Graduate Students' Identities and Experiences</h3>
				<p>This strand explores the personal and professional identities of graduate mathematics students and how these identities intersect with their experiences in graduate programs. Discussions will focus on students’ sense of belonging, imposter syndrome, mentorship, and the social and cultural dimensions of their experiences. Here are some guiding questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How do graduate student navigate their identities as mathematicians, educators, and researchers?</li>
					<li>What factors contribute to or hinder a sense of belonging in graduate mathematics programs?</li>
					<li>How do students’ experiences differ based on factors such as race, gender, or socioeconomic background?</li>
				</ul> 
			</div> </div>

			<div class="column">
				<div class="card"> <h3>Teaching and Pedagogy in Graduate Mathematics Education</h3>
				<p>This strand examines the role of teaching in graduate education, both in terms of how graduate students are taught and how they are prepared to teach. Discussions will explore the effectiveness of graduate coursework, the training of teaching assistants, and how pedagogical practices shape students’ professional development. Here are some guiding questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How well do graduate courses prepare students for research, teaching, and professional work?</li>
					<li>What forms of teaching preparation and mentorship best support graduate students in developing as educators?</li>
					<li>How can graduate programs better incorporate active learning and inclusive pedagogies into their teaching?</li>
				</ul>
			</div> </div>

			<div class="column">
				<div class="card"> <h3>Structures, Policies, and Cultures of Graduate Mathematics Programs</h3>
				<p>This strand focuses on the structural aspects of graduate education, including admissions, qualifying exams, coursework, research expectations, and departmental policies. Discussions will examine how these structures shape student success and well-being, and how they might be reimagined to better support diverse students. Here are some guiding questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How do program structures (e.g., qualifying exams, advising models, funding policies) shape students’ experiences and trajectories?</li>
					<li>What policies or practices may unintentionally create barriers for students, and how can they be addressed?</li>
					<li>How do departmental cultures impact student success, well-being, and professional identity development?</li>
				</ul>
			</div> </div>

			<div class="column">
				<div class="card"> 	<h3>Career Pathways and Professional Development in Graduate Mathematics Education</h3>
				<p>This strand explores the diverse career trajectories of mathematics graduate students, including academic and non-academic pathways. Discussions will focus on professional development, preparation for various careers, and how programs can better support students in pursuing fulfilling career options. Here are some guiding questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>How well do graduate mathematics programs prepare students for careers inside and outside academia?</li>
					<li>What professional development opportunities best support students’ growth as researchers, educators, and professionals?</li>
					<li>How can graduate programs better acknowledge and support non-traditional and alternative career pathways?</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="card"> <h3>Research on Graduate Mathematics Education – Theories, Methodologies, and Emerging Directions</h3>
				<p>This strand focuses on the growing field of research on graduate mathematics education, highlighting the theories, methodologies, and frameworks used to study graduate students’ experiences, identities, and professional development. Discussions will include qualitative and quantitative approaches, interdisciplinary perspectives, and gaps in the existing research. Here are some guiding questions:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>What theoretical frameworks have been used to study graduate mathematics education, and how do they shape our understanding of students’ experiences?</li>
					<li>What methodological approaches are most effective for exploring issues such as identity development, departmental culture, and equity in graduate education?</li>
					<li>What are the emerging research directions in graduate mathematics education, and what gaps still need to be addressed?</li>
					<li>How can research on graduate mathematics education inform policy and practice within mathematics departments?</li>
